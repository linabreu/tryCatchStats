# tryCatchStats
Program utilizes a try/catch block when trying to read from an input file

How it Works:

This program reads test scores from an input file and writes the scores to an output file. It calculates the statistics and writes them to the output file.

The input file contains one test score per line, an output file saves the results, a try/catch block handles the file not found exceptions, and a method is used to read the values,

The statistics for the output file are number of scores processed, sum of scores, average of test scores to two decimal places, the highest and lowest scores.
